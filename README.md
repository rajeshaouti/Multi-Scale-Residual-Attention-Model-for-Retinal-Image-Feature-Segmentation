This study proposes a novel methodology for detecting chemical-induced retinal damage through fundus imaging by leveraging the correlation between retinal abnormalities and chemical exposures. Fundus imaging, a non-invasive and cost-efficient diagnostic modality, is extensively used for detecting ophthalmic and systemic conditions. Pathological manifestations commonly include vascular abnormalities in blood vessels, optic disc deformities, and lesions such as hemorrhages and exudates. Accurate identification and segmentation of these features are crucial for clinically evaluating ocular anomalies. Many pathological conditions share similar manifestations associated with chemical exposure, common to well-known retinal diseases. This paper introduces a multi-scale residual attention U-Net model for retinal feature segmentation and comprehensively maps retinal abnormalities and chemical exposure.
